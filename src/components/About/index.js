                     Hi, I'm Anurag Hazra, a passionate self-taught frontEnd web developer from India, currently working at
                     timeless.co as a FrontEnd engineer. I tend to make use of modern web technologies to build websites that look
                     great, feel fantastic, and function correctly. I am especially focusing on Reactjs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     I'm also a certified graphic designer from "Ramakrishna Mission Shilpamandira". I also do Graphic and UI
                     designing. Since I love both programming and designing, I'm also interested in creating programmatic designs
                     and creative coding projects.
