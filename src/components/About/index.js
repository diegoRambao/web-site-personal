                     Hi, I'm Anurag Hazra, a passionate self-taught frontEnd web developer from India, currently working at
                     timeless.co as a FrontEnd engineer. I tend to make use of modern web technologies to build websites that look
                     great, feel fantastic, and function correctly. I am especially focusing on Reactjs.
